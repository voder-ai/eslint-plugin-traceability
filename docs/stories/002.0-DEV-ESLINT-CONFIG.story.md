# 002.0-DEV-ESLINT-CONFIG: ESLint Configuration Setup

## Release Goal

_Release 0.1: Core Validation - Provide essential ESLint rules that enforce @story and @req annotations on functions and code branches_

This story enables developers to easily configure the ESLint plugin in their projects with sensible defaults and customizable options. It builds upon the plugin foundation (001.0) to provide user-friendly configuration that integrates seamlessly with existing ESLint setups.

## How This Story Contributes

This story is essential for plugin adoption as it determines how easy it is for developers to start using the traceability enforcement. It provides the configuration layer that enables all validation rules to be applied effectively, with options to customize behavior for different project structures and requirements.

## User Story

**Format**: So that I can quickly integrate traceability validation into my project workflow, as a Developer, I want clear and flexible ESLint configuration options that work with my existing ESLint setup and project structure.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be developed after plugin structure (depends on 001.0-DEV-PLUGIN-SETUP)
- **Negotiable**: Configuration options and defaults can be refined during implementation
- **Valuable**: Enables easy adoption and customization of the plugin
- **Estimable**: Scope is clear - configuration system and presets
- **Small**: Can be completed within a single iteration/sprint
- **Testable**: Configuration can be tested with various ESLint setups

## Acceptance Criteria

Use checkbox format for clear completion tracking:

- [ ] **Core Functionality**: Plugin provides recommended and strict configuration presets
- [ ] **Quality Standards**: Configuration follows ESLint v9 flat config best practices
- [ ] **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing ESLint configurations without conflicts
- [ ] **User Experience**: Clear documentation for setup with common project types
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid configuration options
- [ ] **Documentation**: Comprehensive configuration examples and troubleshooting guide

## Requirements (Current Implementation or To Be Implemented)

Document specific technical requirements using the format:

- **REQ-CONFIG-PRESETS**: Provide recommended and strict configuration presets
- **REQ-FLAT-CONFIG**: Support ESLint v9 flat configuration format
- **REQ-CUSTOMIZABLE-PATHS**: Allow customization of story file patterns and locations
- **REQ-RULE-OPTIONS**: Support configurable options for individual rules
- **REQ-PROJECT-INTEGRATION**: Easy integration with TypeScript, JavaScript, and mixed projects
- **REQ-CONFIG-VALIDATION**: Validate configuration options with helpful error messages

## Dependencies

List other stories this story depends on, using numbered story references:

- 001.0-DEV-PLUGIN-SETUP (requires plugin structure foundation)

**Dependency Rules**:

- Story numbers MUST be greater than all dependency story numbers
- Dependencies should be from in-scope stories when possible
- Cross-release dependencies should be clearly justified
- No circular dependencies allowed

## Implementation Notes (Optional)

Additional context for developers:

- Follow ESLint v9 flat config patterns from the development guide
- Provide migration examples from eslintrc to flat config
- Consider different project structures (monorepos, TypeScript projects, etc.)
- Include configuration validation with JSON Schema
- Support both scoped and unscoped package installations
- Document integration with popular ESLint config presets (Airbnb, Standard, etc.)
- Provide configuration generator or CLI helper for initial setup

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing (configuration loading, validation, rule application)
- [ ] Documentation updated (configuration guide, migration examples)
- [ ] Configuration tested with sample projects (TS, JS, mixed)
- [ ] Ready for rule implementation stories (003.0, 004.0, etc.)
