# 008.0-DEV-AUTO-FIX: Simple Auto-Fixes for Annotation Issues

## Release Goal

**Release 0.1: Core Validation** - Provide essential ESLint rules that enforce @story and @req annotations on functions and code branches, with validation that referenced files exist and contain the referenced requirements.

This story enables developers to automatically fix common annotation issues through ESLint's auto-fix functionality, reducing manual effort and accelerating the adoption of traceability practices by making compliance as frictionless as possible.

## How This Story Contributes

Auto-fix capabilities transform the "Fix Issues" experience from manual correction to automated resolution for common problems. This dramatically reduces the friction of maintaining traceability annotations, especially when introducing the plugin to existing codebases with many annotation violations. By providing safe, automated fixes, this story enables teams to quickly achieve compliance and focus on higher-value activities.

This story completes the core "Fix Issues" journey phase by providing both clear error messages (007.0) and automated resolution capabilities.

## User Story

**Format**: So that I can quickly resolve common annotation issues without manual editing, as a Developer, I want the ESLint plugin to automatically fix standard annotation violations when I run ESLint with the --fix option.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be developed using existing validation logic and error reporting from previous stories
- **Negotiable**: The set of auto-fixable issues and fix strategies can be refined during implementation
- **Valuable**: Delivers clear value by reducing manual work and speeding up compliance
- **Estimable**: Scope is well-defined - implement ESLint auto-fix for specific validation rules
- **Small**: Focused on a subset of fixable issues rather than all possible violations
- **Testable**: Auto-fixes can be verified through before/after code comparisons

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Core Functionality**: ESLint --fix automatically resolves common annotation violations
- [ ] **Quality Standards**: Auto-fixes are safe and preserve code functionality and formatting
- [ ] **Integration**: Auto-fix works properly with existing validation rules and ESLint toolchain
- [ ] **User Experience**: Fixes are applied consistently and predictably across different code patterns
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles edge cases where auto-fix cannot be applied safely
- [ ] **Documentation**: Auto-fix capabilities are documented with examples of fixable issues

## Requirements (Current Implementation or To Be Implemented)

- **REQ-AUTOFIX-MISSING**: Automatically add missing @story annotations to functions using template format
- **REQ-AUTOFIX-FORMAT**: Fix common annotation format issues (spacing, syntax, casing)
- **REQ-AUTOFIX-SAFE**: Only apply fixes that are guaranteed to be safe and non-destructive
- **REQ-AUTOFIX-PRESERVE**: Preserve existing code formatting, indentation, and comment structure
- **REQ-AUTOFIX-TEMPLATE**: Use configurable annotation templates for consistent formatting
- **REQ-AUTOFIX-SELECTIVE**: Allow developers to choose which types of fixes to enable/disable

## Dependencies

- 003.0-DEV-FUNCTION-ANNOTATIONS (auto-fix needs to understand function annotation requirements)
- 004.0-DEV-BRANCH-ANNOTATIONS (auto-fix needs to understand branch annotation requirements)
- 005.0-DEV-ANNOTATION-VALIDATION (auto-fix needs validation logic to identify fixable issues)
- 007.0-DEV-ERROR-REPORTING (auto-fix should integrate with error reporting for unfixable issues)

**Dependency Rules**:

- Story numbers MUST be greater than all dependency story numbers
- Dependencies should be from in-scope stories when possible
- Cross-release dependencies should be clearly justified
- No circular dependencies allowed

## Implementation Notes (Optional)

**Development Resources**:
- See [Custom ESLint Rules Development Guide](../custom-rules-development-guide.md) for fix implementation patterns
- Review [Applying Fixes](../custom-rules-development-guide.md#applying-fixes) for comprehensive fixer API documentation
- See [Best Practices](../custom-rules-development-guide.md#best-practices) for safe fix guidelines

**Technical Considerations**:
- Use ESLint's fix API to provide automated corrections
- Implement fixer functions in context.report() using fix(fixer) callback
- Set meta.fixable to "code" or "whitespace" (required for fixable rules)
- Use fixer methods: insertTextBefore(), insertTextAfter(), replaceText(), etc.
- Consider code formatting preservation using AST manipulation
- Provide configuration options for auto-fix behavior
- Follow fix best practices: don't change runtime behavior, make minimal changes, ensure fixes are safe

**Key Guide Sections**:
- [Applying Fixes](../custom-rules-development-guide.md#applying-fixes) - Complete fixer API reference and examples
- [Best Practices](../custom-rules-development-guide.md#best-practices) - Fix safety and performance guidelines

**Integration Points**:

- Enhance existing validation rules with fix capabilities
- Integrate with ESLint's --fix command line option
- Ensure compatibility with IDE auto-fix on save features
- Work with existing code formatters (Prettier, etc.)

**Safe Auto-Fix Scenarios**:

- Adding missing @story annotations with placeholder content
- Fixing annotation comment syntax (@story vs // @story)
- Correcting annotation format spacing and structure
- Standardizing annotation placement (before function vs inline)

**Non-Auto-Fixable Scenarios** (require manual intervention):

- Choosing appropriate story file references
- Adding specific requirement annotations
- Resolving file path issues that require developer knowledge
- Complex formatting conflicts with existing code style

**Testing Strategy**:

- Unit tests for each auto-fix scenario with before/after comparisons
- Integration tests with various code patterns and existing formatting
- Edge case testing for complex code structures
- Manual testing with real codebases to verify safety and effectiveness
