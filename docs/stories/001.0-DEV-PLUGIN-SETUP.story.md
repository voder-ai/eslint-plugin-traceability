# 001.0-DEV-PLUGIN-SETUP: ESLint Plugin Structure Foundation

## Release Goal

_Release 0.1: Core Validation - Provide essential ESLint rules that enforce @story and @req annotations on functions and code branches_

This story establishes the foundational structure for the ESLint plugin that will enforce code traceability annotations. It creates the basic plugin architecture that enables all subsequent validation rules and features in Release 0.1.

## How This Story Contributes

This story is critical as the foundation for the entire traceability enforcement system. Without a properly structured ESLint plugin, no validation rules can be implemented. It enables all other stories in Release 0.1 by providing the plugin architecture, rule registration system, and basic infrastructure that subsequent stories will build upon.

## User Story

**Format**: So that I can enforce code traceability standards across my project, as a Developer, I want an ESLint plugin structure that can validate @story and @req annotations on functions and code branches.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be developed independently - no dependencies on other stories
- **Negotiable**: Plugin structure details can be refined during implementation
- **Valuable**: Delivers the foundation needed for all traceability enforcement
- **Estimable**: Scope is clear - standard ESLint plugin structure
- **Small**: Can be completed within a single iteration/sprint
- **Testable**: Plugin can be tested for proper registration and basic functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

Use checkbox format for clear completion tracking:

- [ ] **Core Functionality**: ESLint plugin properly registers and loads without errors
- [ ] **Quality Standards**: Follows ESLint plugin development best practices and conventions
- [ ] **Integration**: Works properly with ESLint v9 flat config
- [ ] **User Experience**: Plugin can be installed and configured with clear setup instructions
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles plugin loading errors and missing dependencies
- [ ] **Documentation**: Plugin structure and development setup is properly documented

## Requirements (Current Implementation or To Be Implemented)

Document specific technical requirements using the format:

- **REQ-PLUGIN-STRUCTURE**: ESLint plugin follows standard Node.js module structure
- **REQ-ESLINT-COMPAT**: Compatible with ESLint v9 flat configuration
- **REQ-RULE-REGISTRY**: Provides mechanism to register multiple validation rules
- **REQ-CONFIG-SYSTEM**: Supports plugin configuration options for customization
- **REQ-NPM-PACKAGE**: Properly structured as publishable npm package
- **REQ-TYPESCRIPT**: Written in TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **REQ-TEST-SETUP**: Includes testing infrastructure for rule validation

## Dependencies

List other stories this story depends on, using numbered story references:

- None (This is the foundational story)

**Dependency Rules**:

- Story numbers MUST be greater than all dependency story numbers
- Dependencies should be from in-scope stories when possible
- Cross-release dependencies should be clearly justified
- No circular dependencies allowed

## Implementation Notes (Optional)

Additional context for developers:

**Development Resources**:

- See [Custom ESLint Rules Development Guide](../custom-rules-development-guide.md) for comprehensive rule development patterns
- Use official ESLint plugin template and conventions
- Structure should support both CommonJS and ESM module systems
- Consider using @typescript-eslint/utils for TypeScript AST parsing utilities
- Plugin should be scoped (e.g., @eslint-plugin-traceability or similar)
- Include proper package.json configuration for ESLint plugin discovery
- Set up development environment with hot reloading for rule testing

**Key Guide Sections**:

- [Rule Structure](../custom-rules-development-guide.md#rule-structure) - Basic rule anatomy and meta properties
- [Testing Rules](../custom-rules-development-guide.md#testing-rules) - Using RuleTester for validation
- [Best Practices](../custom-rules-development-guide.md#best-practices) - Performance and maintainability guidelines

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing (plugin loads, registers rules)
- [ ] Documentation updated (README with setup instructions)
- [ ] Plugin can be installed locally and configured in test project
- [ ] Ready for subsequent rule implementation stories
