  <evidence>1. No rule or code implements REQ-AUTOFIX-FORMAT (fixers for spacing, syntax, casing) or REQ-AUTOFIX-SELECTIVE (configurable enable/disable) or REQ-AUTOFIX-TEMPLATE (customizable templates).  
2. The only fixers present are in require-story-annotation.ts and require-req-annotation.ts (inserting placeholder comments) and branch annotation rule; there are no fixers in valid-annotation-format.ts or any mechanism to configure which fixes run.  
3. No tests for auto-fix formatting scenarios or for selective‐fix configuration under story 008.0.  
4. No reference to docs/stories/008.0-DEV-AUTO-FIX.story.md in any code, tests, or configuration.</evidence>
  <notes>The plugin currently auto-fixes only missing @story/@req annotations on functions and branches. The broader auto-fix requirements in 008.0 (format corrections, template customization, selective fixes, safe-fix guarantees beyond inserting placeholders) have not been implemented or tested.</notes>
