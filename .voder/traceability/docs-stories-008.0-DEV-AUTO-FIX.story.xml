  <evidence>Although built-in ESLint fixers exist for missing @story/@req annotations in the “require-…” rules (from stories 003 and 004), there is no implementation or tests covering the new auto-fix scenarios defined in 008.0.  No rule in src/rules implements REQ-AUTOFIX-FORMAT, REQ-AUTOFIX-TEMPLATE or REQ-AUTOFIX-SELECTIVE; valid-annotation-format, valid-story-reference and valid-req-reference do not provide fixers; no CLI or rule schema exposes configuration to enable/disable specific fixes; and there are no tests targeting auto-fix behaviors in docs/stories/008.0-DEV-AUTO-FIX.story.md.</evidence>
  <notes>The project only auto-fixes missing annotations (from earlier stories) but does not implement the broader set of safe, configurable auto-fix features (formatting corrections, template customization, selective enabling, edge-case handling, and documentation) required by story 008.0.  Therefore, the specification is not yet implemented.</notes>
