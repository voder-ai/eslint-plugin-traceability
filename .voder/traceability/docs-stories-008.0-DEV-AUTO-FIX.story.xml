  <evidence>Previous assessment: FAILED
Inspection of src/rules shows fixers implemented for missing @story (require-story-annotation), missing @req (require-req-annotation), and missing branch annotations (require-branch-annotation) but no auto-fixers for annotation formatting issues (valid-annotation-format rule has no fixer functions). There is no support for configurable annotation templates (templates are hard-coded) nor any option to selectively enable/disable specific fix types. Documentation (README.md or docs) contains no examples or explanation of the new auto-fix functionality. No tests cover format auto-fix or template customization. Therefore several requirements (REQ-AUTOFIX-FORMAT, REQ-AUTOFIX-TEMPLATE, REQ-AUTOFIX-SELECTIVE, documentation) are unmet.</evidence>
  <notes>Reset for re-assessment this cycle. Previous: Core auto-fixers for missing annotations exist, but the feature set is incomplete. Format-fix capabilities, configurable templates, selective enabling, and documentation of auto-fixes are missing.</notes>
