  <evidence>While the plugin includes fixer functions for missing @story (require-story-annotation) and @req (require-req-annotation) and branch annotations (require-branch-annotation) as exercised by their respective tests, there is no implementation of auto-fixers for common format issues (REQ-AUTOFIX-FORMAT) in valid-annotation-format.ts (meta.fixable is missing and no fixer functions are provided). Moreover, there is no support for configurable annotation templates (REQ-AUTOFIX-TEMPLATE) or selective enabling/disabling of specific fixes (REQ-AUTOFIX-SELECTIVE) in any rule schema or code. Documentation (docs/rules/*.md and README) does not describe auto-fix examples or configuration options for these requirements.</evidence>
  <notes>Core missing-annotation auto-fixers are in place, but key story requirements around format fixes, template configurability, and selective fix control have not been implemented.</notes>
