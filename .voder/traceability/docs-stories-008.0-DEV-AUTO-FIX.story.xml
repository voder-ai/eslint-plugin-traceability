  <evidence>• The require-story-annotation rule (src/rules/require-story-annotation.ts) does not declare `meta.fixable` and only offers ESLint suggestions, not real auto‐fixers invoked by `--fix`.
• The valid-annotation-format rule (src/rules/valid-annotation-format.ts) reports format errors but includes no fixer implementations.
• No code implements configurable templates (REQ-AUTOFIX-TEMPLATE) or selective enabling/disabling of specific fixes (REQ-AUTOFIX-SELECTIVE).
• No documentation examples of running ESLint with `--fix` to auto-resolve annotation issues.
</evidence>
  <notes>Story 008.0-DEV-AUTO-FIX defines acceptance criteria to auto‐fix missing/formatting issues for both @story and @req, but the plugin only provides suggestions for missing @story (not real fixes), implements fixes only for @req and branch annotations, and lacks format fixers, templates, or selective controls. Thus the story is not fully implemented.</notes>
