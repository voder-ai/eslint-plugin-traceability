  <evidence>– src/maintenance/* and tests/maintenance/* implement and cover REQ-MAINT-DETECT, REQ-MAINT-UPDATE, REQ-MAINT-BATCH, REQ-MAINT-VERIFY, REQ-MAINT-REPORT (all tests pass)
– No handling or tests for REQ-MAINT-SAFE beyond tagging (no reversible operation guarantees or rollback API)
– No CLI entrypoints or npm scripts for invoking maintenance tools (package.json has no maintenance commands)
– No user‐facing documentation or examples in README.md or user-docs/ for usage of maintenance tools
– No integration layer with existing ESLint plugin workflows (no documentation or tests for ESLint config integration)
</evidence>
  <notes>While the core detection and update functions and their batch/verify/report counterparts are implemented and tested, several acceptance criteria are unmet: there is no user documentation or CLI for the tools; no explicit support for reversible/safe operations (REQ-MAINT-SAFE) beyond a tag; and no demonstrated integration or UX feedback layer. Therefore the story is not fully satisfied.</notes>
