  <evidence>All maintenance tools for Story 009.0-DEV-MAINTENANCE-TOOLS are implemented and exercised by Jest tests:

• src/maintenance/index.ts exports all five APIs with @req tags (REQ-MAINT-DETECT, -UPDATE, -BATCH, -VERIFY, -REPORT, -SAFE).
• detectStaleAnnotations is covered by tests in tests/maintenance/detect.test.ts and detect-isolated.test.ts (REQ-MAINT-DETECT).
• updateAnnotationReferences is covered by update.test.ts and update-isolated.test.ts (REQ-MAINT-UPDATE).
• batchUpdateAnnotations and verifyAnnotations are covered by batch.test.ts (REQ-MAINT-BATCH, REQ-MAINT-VERIFY).
• generateMaintenanceReport is covered by report.test.ts (REQ-MAINT-REPORT).
• Edge cases (missing directory, permission errors) are handled and tested (error handling).

Jest summary: 19 suites, 106 tests, 0 failures.</evidence>
  <notes>The implementation fully satisfies the story’s listed requirements (REQ-MAINT-*) and core acceptance criteria. All tests pass, demonstrating detection, update, batch, verification, and reporting functionality along with safe exports.</notes>
