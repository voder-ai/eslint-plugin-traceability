  <evidence>• Core modules implemented under src/maintenance with corresponding tests passing (detect.ts, update.ts, batch.ts, report.ts), achieving overall test coverage ~97%.
• Tests validate detection of stale annotations, single update operations, batch empty mappings, verify true on valid annotations, and report generation for stale annotations.
• Missing tests and implementation for several acceptance criteria:
  – No CLI entrypoint or commands provided for maintenance operations (story requests “Implement CLI tools for common maintenance operations”).
  – No user-facing feedback mechanism (console output or logs) to indicate what changed during operations.
  – No documentation (README or user guide) with usage examples and best practices for these tools.
  – Error handling is minimal (permission errors bubble up, no graceful reporting of edge cases like circular references).
  – No support for reversal (“reversible operations”) or undo capability as per REQ-MAINT-SAFE.
  – verifyAnnotations lacks a test for returning false when stale annotations exist.
• No integration with ESLint plugin infrastructure or Git hooks as suggested in the story.</evidence>
  <notes>While core detection, update, batch, verify and report functions exist and are tested, key user experience, CLI integration, documentation, error handling, and safety requirements from the acceptance criteria remain unimplemented.</notes>
