  <evidence>Found implementation for REQ-MAINT-DETECT, REQ-MAINT-UPDATE, REQ-MAINT-BATCH, REQ-MAINT-VERIFY, and REQ-MAINT-REPORT in src/maintenance with accompanying Jest tests (all passing). However, acceptance criteria for “User Experience” (no CLI interface or user feedback messages implemented), “Documentation” (no usage docs or best practices under docs/), and integration with existing ESLint config (no hooks or CLI integration) are not met. No CLI tool or file‐watching support is provided, and no documentation/examples exist for maintenance tools.</evidence>
  <notes>While core functions and tests are implemented, key acceptance criteria (CLI UX, documentation, and integration) remain unaddressed.</notes>
