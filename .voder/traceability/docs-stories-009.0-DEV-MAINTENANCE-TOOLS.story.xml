  <evidence>- All existing unit tests in tests/maintenance for detect, update, batch, verify, and report pass, but:
  • src/maintenance/index.ts (the public API surface) has 0% test coverage (no integration or import tests exercising the exports). 
  • src/maintenance/utils.ts declares @req REQ-MAINT-UTILS, which is not defined in the story’s requirements list. No tests cover this helper. 
  • There is no documentation (in README.md, docs/ or user-docs/) describing usage examples or best practices for the maintenance tools, despite the Acceptance Criteria requiring documentation.
</evidence>
  <notes>While the core maintenance functions and their basic unit behaviors are implemented and tested, key acceptance criteria are unmet: missing documentation and usage guides, missing integration tests for the public API (index.ts), and a helper requirement mismatch. Therefore the story is not fully implemented.</notes>
