  <evidence>- Found src/rules/valid-annotation-format.ts implementing the format validation logic with regex checks for @story and @req per the spec requirements (REQ-FORMAT-SPECIFICATION, REQ-SYNTAX-VALIDATION, REQ-PATH-FORMAT, REQ-REQ-FORMAT, REQ-MULTILINE-SUPPORT, REQ-FLEXIBLE-PARSING, REQ-ERROR-SPECIFICITY).
- Tests present in tests/rules/valid-annotation-format.test.ts referencing the story file, covering valid and invalid cases for both @story and @req formats.
- Documentation exists in docs/rules/valid-annotation-format.md with specification and examples of valid/invalid annotations.
- The rule is exported in src/index.ts and included in plugin configs, demonstrating integration.
- Project-wide tests (npm test) execute without errors, indicating rules behave as expected.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for core functionality, quality standards, integration, user experience, error handling, and documentation are satisfied. The implementation aligns directly with the story’s requirements and tests cover the specified scenarios.</notes>
