  <evidence>The `valid-annotation-format` rule is present in src/rules/valid-annotation-format.ts with appropriate meta, messages, and schema. Tests in tests/rules/valid-annotation-format.test.ts cover valid and invalid @story and @req formats, including block comments and single-line comments, and all tests pass (100% statements, 100% lines, 92.85% branches). Documentation exists at docs/rules/valid-annotation-format.md with examples matching implementation. The rule is exported in src/index.ts and included in both 'recommended' and 'strict' configs. ESLint linting, Jest testing, type checking, and coverage checks all pass.</evidence>
  <notes>The annotation format validation rule fully meets the story’s acceptance criteria: it validates @story and @req syntax, follows ESLint best practices, integrates with other rules, provides clear error messages, handles edge cases (multiline/block comments), and is documented with examples. Tests ensure REQ-FORMAT-SPECIFICATION, REQ-SYNTAX-VALIDATION, REQ-PATH-FORMAT, REQ-REQ-FORMAT, REQ-MULTILINE-SUPPORT, REQ-FLEXIBLE-PARSING, and REQ-ERROR-SPECIFICITY are satisfied.</notes>
