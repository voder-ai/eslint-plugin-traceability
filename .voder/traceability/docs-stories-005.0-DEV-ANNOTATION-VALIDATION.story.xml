  <evidence>• src/rules/valid-annotation-format.ts implements the rule with JSDoc @story and @req tags referencing docs/stories/005.0-DEV-ANNOTATION-VALIDATION.story.md and includes regex checks for story paths and req IDs.
• tests/rules/valid-annotation-format.test.ts covers valid and invalid @story/@req patterns (inline and block), and `npm test` passes with no failures.
• docs/rules/valid-annotation-format.md provides format specification and examples of valid and invalid annotations.
• The rule is exported in src/index.ts and included in the plugin’s recommended config.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria are satisfied:
- Core functionality for syntax/format validation is implemented and tested.
- ESLint rule follows best practices (meta, docs, messages, schema).
- Multiline and flexible parsing are supported.
- Clear error messages (invalidStoryFormat vs invalidReqFormat).
- Documentation updated with examples.
Thus, the annotation format validation feature is fully implemented.</notes>
