  <evidence>Found a fully implemented ESLint rule in src/rules/valid-annotation-format.ts that scans all comments for @story and @req lines and applies regex-based format checks. Tests in tests/rules/valid-annotation-format.test.ts (and corresponding JS variants under lib/tests) verify both valid and invalid annotation patterns by messageId. Documentation exists in docs/rules/valid-annotation-format.md, and the rule is registered in src/index.ts and included in the recommended config. All tests for this rule pass as part of the CI-verified 100% suite.</evidence>
  <notes>The implementation meets all Acceptance Criteria: it validates format and syntax, follows ESLint best practices, integrates with function/branch annotation rules, provides specific error messages, handles multi-line and whitespace variations, and is documented with examples. No unmet requirements were found.</notes>
