  <evidence>- src/rules/valid-annotation-format.ts includes JSDoc linking to docs/stories/005.0-DEV-ANNOTATION-VALIDATION.story.md and implements regex checks for @story and @req tags matching the specified format patterns.  
- Tests in tests/rules/valid-annotation-format.test.ts reference the story file, cover valid and invalid @story and @req cases (path missing, wrong extension, missing or malformed ID), and define messageIds invalidStoryFormat and invalidReqFormat.  
- The rule is exported in src/index.ts and enabled in the recommended and strict configs.  
- Code handles both block and line comments, uses flexible whitespace parsing, distinguishes story vs req format errors, and integrates with ESLint rule conventions.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria and technical requirements (format specification, syntax validation, path and req identifier patterns, multiline comment support, flexible parsing, and specific error messages) are implemented and covered by tests. The rule follows ESLint best practices and is integrated into the plugin configuration.</notes>
