  <evidence>Found src/rules/valid-annotation-format.ts implementing the rule with @story and @req format checks (regex for path and ID), complete with JSDoc traceability to docs/stories/005.0-DEV-ANNOTATION-VALIDATION.story.md and REQ tags. The corresponding tests in tests/rules/valid-annotation-format.test.ts cover valid and invalid cases (block comments, missing identifier, bad extension, etc.). Documentation exists in docs/rules/valid-annotation-format.md with examples. The rule is exported in src/index.ts and included in the recommended config. All tests for this rule pass.</evidence>
  <notes>The annotation format validation rule is fully implemented per the story’s acceptance criteria, including format checks, error messages, documentation, and integration into the plugin.</notes>
