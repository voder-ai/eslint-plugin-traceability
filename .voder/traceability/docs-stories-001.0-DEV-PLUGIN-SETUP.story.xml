  <evidence>• All 19 Jest test suites passed (106 tests) with no failures (see jest-results.json).
• src/index.ts exports a standard ESLint plugin structure with `rules` and `configs` (annotated with @story docs/stories/001.0-DEV-PLUGIN-SETUP.story.md and @req REQ-PLUGIN-STRUCTURE).
• Plugin default export, rule registry (rules object), and config system (configs.recommended and configs.strict) are validated by tests in plugin-default-export-and-configs.test.ts and plugin-setup.test.ts.
• CLI integration tests in tests/integration/cli-integration.test.ts prove compatibility with ESLint v9 flat config and loading of plugin without errors.
• README.md includes clear installation and flat-config setup instructions, satisfying user-experience documentation.
• TypeScript is used throughout (src/*.ts), and test infrastructure (ts-jest, jest.config.js) is in place, covering REQ-TYPESCRIPT and REQ-TEST-SETUP.
</evidence>
  <notes>The foundational plugin structure meets all defined acceptance criteria and technical requirements. The plugin load, rule registration, flat-config integration, documentation, and test infrastructure are implemented and verified via automated tests.</notes>
