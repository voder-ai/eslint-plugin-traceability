  <evidence>- src/index.ts exports plugin.rules and plugin.configs in standard ESLint plugin structure with TypeScript and traceability annotations (@story docs/stories/001.0-DEV-PLUGIN-SETUP.story.md, @req REQ-PLUGIN-STRUCTURE).
- package.json defines main and types fields, scripts for build, lint, test, and peerDependencies, conforming to npm package conventions.
- tsconfig.json and build script (`npm run build`) compile TypeScript source to CommonJS without errors.
- tests/basic.test.ts verifies that plugin.rules and plugin.configs are defined and correctly exported (Basic plugin structure test for Story 001.0).
- tests/integration/plugin-validation.test.ts invokes ESLint CLI with flat config (eslint.config.js) and confirms rule errors as expected, demonstrating ESLint v9 flat config integration.
- README.md and docs/eslint-9-setup-guide.md include clear installation and configuration instructions for the plugin.
- eslint.config.js handles plugin loading errors via try/catch, satisfying graceful error handling.
- All Jest tests pass under CI (`npm test`), and CLI integration script (cli-integration.js) also confirms plugin registration behavior.

  <notes>The foundational ESLint plugin structure defined in 001.0-DEV-PLUGIN-SETUP has been implemented: the plugin registers rules and configs, compiles cleanly under TypeScript, integrates with ESLint v9 flat config, includes comprehensive tests for module exports and CLI behavior, and provides clear documentation and error handling. All acceptance criteria and technical requirements for this story are satisfied.</notes>
