  <evidence>1. Tests referencing 001.0-DEV-PLUGIN-SETUP.story.md exist and pass without errors (plugin-default-export-and-configs.test.ts, plugin-setup.test.ts).
2. CLI integration script (cli-integration.js) executed successfully:
   ✓ reports error when @story annotation is missing
   ✓ does not report error when @story annotation is present
   ✓ reports error when @req annotation is missing
   ✓ reports error on path traversal and absolute path misuse
3. build (tsc -p tsconfig.json) completed with no errors.
4. README.md contains clear installation and configuration instructions for ESLint v9 flat config.
5. eslint.config.js demonstrates plugin loading with try/catch for missing builds and integrates the plugin under ESLint v9 flat config.
6. package.json correctly defines main, types, files, peerDependencies, and npm scripts for build, test, lint, and format.
7. src/index.ts exports rules and configs per standard ESLint plugin structure; configs.recommended and configs.strict are registered and identical as required.</evidence>
  <notes>The foundational ESLint plugin structure is implemented correctly. All acceptance criteria—including core functionality, ESLint v9 flat-config integration, documentation, error handling, and quality standards—are satisfied. All technical requirements (REQ-PLUGIN-STRUCTURE, REQ-ESLINT-COMPAT, REQ-RULE-REGISTRY, REQ-CONFIG-SYSTEM, REQ-NPM-PACKAGE, REQ-TYPESCRIPT, REQ-TEST-SETUP) have concrete evidence of implementation.</notes>
