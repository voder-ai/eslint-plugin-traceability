  <evidence>All Jest suites referencing docs/stories/001.0-DEV-PLUGIN-SETUP.story.md passed (plugin-default-export-and-configs.test.ts, plugin-setup.test.ts, tests/integration/cli-integration.test.ts). Total suites for this story: 3, total tests: 12, failures: 0. src/index.ts exports `rules` and `configs` as tested, package.json and README demonstrate ESLint v9 flat-config compatibility and installation instructions.</evidence>
  <notes>The core plugin structure (REQ-PLUGIN-STRUCTURE), rule registry (REQ-RULE-REGISTRY), config system (REQ-CONFIG-SYSTEM), ESLint v9 flat-config integration (REQ-ESLINT-COMPAT), TypeScript implementation (REQ-TYPESCRIPT), npm package setup (REQ-NPM-PACKAGE), and test infrastructure (REQ-TEST-SETUP) are all in place and verified by tests. Documentation in README.md covers installation and configuration, and the CLI integration tests exercise plugin loading and error cases. All acceptance criteria and requirements for this foundational story have been satisfied.</notes>
