  <evidence>• Unit tests in tests/index.test.ts verify default export includes rules and configs, correct rule registry (REQ-PLUGIN-STRUCTURE, REQ-RULE-REGISTRY, REQ-CONFIG-SYSTEM) and all pass (Jest 100% pass rate).
• CLI integration tests in tests/integration/plugin-validation.test.ts and cli-integration.js (Story 001.0-DEV-PLUGIN-SETUP) execute ESLint with flat config (eslint.config.js) and confirm plugin loads, registers rules, and reports errors appropriately (Core Functionality, Integration).
• eslint.config.js uses try/catch around require("./lib/index.js"), satisfying graceful error handling (Error Handling).
• README.md and docs/eslint-9-setup-guide.md contain installation and configuration instructions (User Experience, Documentation).
• package.json main/types fields, TS source in src/, build step in scripts, and peerDependencies:eslint satisfy REQ-NPM-PACKAGE, REQ-TYPESCRIPT, and REQ-ESLINT-COMPAT.
• All CI checks (build, type-check, lint, test, coverage) pass with no errors.</evidence>
  <notes>The foundational plugin structure has been implemented according to the story’s acceptance criteria and requirements. The plugin exports rules and configs, supports ESLint v9 flat config, includes error handling for loading failures, provides clear documentation, and is covered by unit and CLI integration tests. All acceptance criteria are satisfied.</notes>
