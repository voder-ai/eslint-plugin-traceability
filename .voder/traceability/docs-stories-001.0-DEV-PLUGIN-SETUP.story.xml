  <evidence>The plugin’s core export and CLI integration tests pass (see tests/plugin-setup.test.ts and tests/integration/cli-integration.test.ts), showing REQ-PLUGIN-STRUCTURE, REQ-ESLINT-COMPAT, REQ-RULE-REGISTRY, REQ-CONFIG-SYSTEM, REQ-NPM-PACKAGE, REQ-TYPESCRIPT, and REQ-TEST-SETUP are implemented. However, there is no code or tests addressing “gracefully handles plugin loading errors and missing dependencies” (no try/catch or error‐reporting in src/index.ts or rule modules, and no test case for dependency failures).</evidence>
  <notes>While most technical requirements and acceptance criteria are met and verified by tests, the error‐handling criterion is not implemented or tested, so the story is not fully satisfied.</notes>
