  <evidence>1) All unit tests passed (jest --ci --bail): plugin-setup.test.ts, plugin-default-export-and-configs.test.ts and all rule tests succeed with 97%+ coverage. 2) CLI integration script (cli-integration.js) passes all scenarios against ESLint v9 flat config. 3) `src/index.ts` exports `rules` and `configs` as expected. 4) `package.json` is configured as a publishable npm package (main, types, files). 5) README.md and docs/ contain installation, usage, flat-config examples, and development guides. 6) eslint.config.js demonstrates flat-config integration with try/catch error handling for missing build. 7) smoke-test.sh installs and verifies the plugin in a clean project, confirming install/configure UX and error-handling.</evidence>
  <notes>The foundational ESLint plugin structure meets all acceptance criteria and requirements: it registers and loads rules without errors, follows plugin conventions, integrates with ESLint v9 flat config, provides clear install/config instructions, includes error handling for missing builds, is fully documented, written in TypeScript, packaged correctly, and has comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, smoke).</notes>
