  <evidence>1. In docs/stories/010.0-DEV-DEEP-VALIDATION.story.md the Requirements section lists six requirement IDs:
   • REQ-DEEP-PARSE
   • REQ-DEEP-MATCH
   • REQ-DEEP-FORMAT
   • REQ-DEEP-SECTION
   • REQ-DEEP-CACHE
   • REQ-DEEP-ERROR

2. In src/rules/valid-req-reference.ts (the implementation) the JSDoc lists only four @req tags:
   • REQ-DEEP-PARSE
   • REQ-DEEP-MATCH
   • REQ-DEEP-CACHE
   • REQ-DEEP-PATH  (not in the spec)

3. The documentation file docs/rules/valid-req-reference.md likewise references only REQ-DEEP-PARSE, REQ-DEEP-MATCH, and REQ-DEEP-PATH, but omits REQ-DEEP-FORMAT, REQ-DEEP-SECTION, and REQ-DEEP-ERROR required by the story spec.

4. Test suite covers parsing requirements, missing-requirement errors, bullet-list fixtures, and path traversal, but there are no tests or annotations exercising or documenting REQ-DEEP-FORMAT, REQ-DEEP-SECTION, or REQ-DEEP-ERROR.

  <notes>The core deep-validation rule (valid-req-reference) is implemented and all related tests pass, but it does not fully implement or trace back to the full set of requirement IDs defined in the story (specifically REQ-DEEP-FORMAT, REQ-DEEP-SECTION, REQ-DEEP-ERROR), and it introduces a non-spec requirement ID REQ-DEEP-PATH. Documentation and code annotations must be updated to align precisely with the story’s requirements.</notes>
