  <evidence>In src/rules/valid-req-reference.ts the JSDoc @req tags reference REQ-DEEP-PARSE, REQ-DEEP-MATCH, REQ-DEEP-CACHE and REQ-DEEP-PATH, but the story (docs/stories/010.0-DEV-DEEP-VALIDATION.story.md) defines REQ-DEEP-PARSE, REQ-DEEP-MATCH, REQ-DEEP-FORMAT, REQ-DEEP-SECTION, REQ-DEEP-CACHE and REQ-DEEP-ERROR. The rule documentation (docs/rules/valid-req-reference.md) likewise only lists REQ-DEEP-PARSE, REQ-DEEP-MATCH and REQ-DEEP-PATH. There are no annotations or examples covering REQ-DEEP-FORMAT, REQ-DEEP-SECTION or REQ-DEEP-ERROR, and instead a non-spec requirement REQ-DEEP-PATH is present.</evidence>
  <notes>While the core validation logic and tests for matching or missing requirement IDs pass, the implementation and rule documentation do not fully align with the story’s defined requirements. Several named requirements are unimplemented in traceability annotations and documentation, so the story is not yet fully satisfied.</notes>
