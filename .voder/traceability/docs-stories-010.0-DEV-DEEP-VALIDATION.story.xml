  <evidence>- src/rules/valid-req-reference.ts implements deep validation logic with AST comment parsing, path resolution, caching, regex-based requirement extraction, and reports both invalidPath and reqMissing messages.
- Tests in tests/rules/valid-req-reference.test.ts cover valid references (including bullet-list fixture), missing requirements, path traversal, and absolute paths, all passing under Jest: exit code 0, coverage report included.
- Documentation in docs/rules/valid-req-reference.md and docs/stories/010.0-DEV-DEEP-VALIDATION.story.md align, and the plugin builds, lints, type-checks, and tests successfully (npm test shows 96%+ statements, 84%+ branches overall).</evidence>
  <notes>The implementation provides the required core functionality for deep requirement content validation: it parses story files, matches @req IDs, handles path errors, caches content, reports clear errors, and is fully tested. All acceptance criteria are satisfied.</notes>
