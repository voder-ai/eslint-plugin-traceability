  <evidence>The rule `valid-req-reference` is implemented in `src/rules/valid-req-reference.ts` with JSDoc annotations pointing to `docs/stories/010.0-DEV-DEEP-VALIDATION.story.md` and requirement IDs `REQ-DEEP-PARSE`, `REQ-DEEP-MATCH`, `REQ-DEEP-CACHE`, and path‐validation logic (`REQ-DEEP-PATH`). It parses story files (via regex), caches results, and reports two clear error messages (`invalidPath` and `reqMissing`).

Unit tests in `tests/rules/valid-req-reference.test.ts` reference the story file, cover valid and invalid cases (including bullet‐list fixtures in `tests/fixtures/story_bullet.md`), and the full test suite passes (see Jest output – 95.57% statements, tests exit code 0). Documentation exists in `docs/rules/valid-req-reference.md` with examples and references back to the story file.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria are met: core functionality works (REQ annotations are matched against actual content), it integrates with existing validation logic, handles path errors, provides clear messages, caches parsing, and is documented with examples. Tests pass and trace back to the story, satisfying end-to-end deep validation.</notes>
