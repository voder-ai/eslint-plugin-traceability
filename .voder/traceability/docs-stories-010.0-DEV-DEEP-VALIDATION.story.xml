  <evidence>All 19 test suites (106 tests) passed, including the valid-req-reference rule tests in tests/rules/valid-req-reference.test.ts. The implementation in src/rules/valid-req-reference.ts covers REQ-DEEP-PARSE, REQ-DEEP-MATCH, REQ-DEEP-CACHE, path validation (invalidPath), and emits clear reqMissing errors. The fixture story_bullet.md is parsed correctly (bullet-list format) and missing-bullet cases fail as expected. CI logs (jest-results.json) show zero failures.</evidence>
  <notes>The deep-validation rule fully implements core functionality and error handling per the story: it parses story files, matches @req IDs, caches results, and reports precise errors for missing requirements and invalid paths. Tests cover bullet-list formats and path edge cases; the generic regex-based parser also supports numbered or custom REQ- patterns. Documentation in docs/rules/valid-req-reference.md and code comments link back to the story, satisfying integration and traceability requirements.</notes>
