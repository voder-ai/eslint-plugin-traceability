  <evidence>The deep-validation rule implementation is present in src/rules/valid-req-reference.ts with JSDoc tags pointing to docs/stories/010.0-DEV-DEEP-VALIDATION.story.md and @req IDs REQ-DEEP-PARSE, REQ-DEEP-MATCH, REQ-DEEP-CACHE. The rule is exported in src/index.ts and included in the recommended config. There is a dedicated RuleTester suite in tests/rules/valid-req-reference.test.ts covering valid cases (matching REQ-PLUGIN-STRUCTURE in docs/stories/001.0-DEV-PLUGIN-SETUP.story.md and REQ-BULLET-LIST in tests/fixtures/story_bullet.md) and invalid cases (missing IDs, path traversal, absolute paths). Documentation exists in docs/rules/valid-req-reference.md referencing the story file and describing errors and behavior. CLI integration tests in tests/integration/cli-integration.test.ts also cover error reporting for invalid paths. All acceptance criteria—core functionality, format handling via regex, caching, clear error messages, cross-story integration, and documentation—are implemented and tested.</evidence>
  <notes>The rule correctly parses story files, caches results, matches @req IDs, rejects invalid or missing requirements, provides specific error messages, and is accompanied by tests and documentation. It satisfies REQ-DEEP-PARSE, REQ-DEEP-MATCH, REQ-DEEP-FORMAT, REQ-DEEP-CACHE, and REQ-DEEP-ERROR requirements. Therefore, story 010.0-DEV-DEEP-VALIDATION is fully implemented.</notes>
