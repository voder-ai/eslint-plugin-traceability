  <evidence>Previous assessment: PASSED
The deep‐validation rule is implemented in src/rules/valid-req-reference.ts and is covered by a dedicated test suite at tests/rules/valid-req-reference.test.ts.  
– The rule extracts @story and @req annotations, resolves and sanitizes story paths, reads and parses the target markdown for REQ-IDs, caches results, and reports `invalidPath` or `reqMissing` as appropriate.  
– The test file declares its linkage to docs/stories/010.0-DEV-DEEP-VALIDATION.story.md and verifies both valid (including bullet‐list fixture at tests/fixtures/story_bullet.md) and invalid scenarios (missing requirement, path traversal, absolute path).  
– User‐facing documentation lives in docs/rules/valid-req-reference.md, which describes the rule’s behavior and shows correct and incorrect examples.  
All acceptance criteria (core functionality, error messages, integration, caching, path checks, and basic format support) are implemented and tested.</evidence>
  <notes>Reset for re-assessment this cycle. Previous: The deep-validation feature described in 010.0-DEV-DEEP-VALIDATION is fully implemented, integrated into the plugin, and validated by automated tests. Potential future refinements (e.g., explicit numbered-list examples in docs) can be considered, but the story’s stated acceptance criteria are satisfied.</notes>
