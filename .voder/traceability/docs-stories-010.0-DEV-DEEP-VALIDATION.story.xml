  <evidence>- Found and read the deep-validation specification at docs/stories/010.0-DEV-DEEP-VALIDATION.story.md
- Implementation present in src/rules/valid-req-reference.ts with @story and @req traceability tags
- Rule logic parses and caches story files, extracts REQ- identifiers, reports clear errors for missing IDs and invalid paths
- Documentation for the rule exists in docs/rules/valid-req-reference.md with examples
- Unit tests in tests/rules/valid-req-reference.test.ts cover valid and invalid scenarios (path traversal, missing IDs, bullet-list fixture), referencing the story file
- `npm test` (Jest) passed without errors and shows coverage for valid-req-reference
</evidence>
  <notes>The deep validation ESLint rule correctly implements REQ-DEEP-PARSE, REQ-DEEP-MATCH, REQ-DEEP-CACHE and REQ-DEEP-PATH requirements, integrates with existing annotation logic, provides clear error messages, handles malformed or missing files gracefully, and is documented and tested. All acceptance criteria are satisfied.</notes>
