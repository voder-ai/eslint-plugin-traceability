  <evidence>The `valid-req-reference` rule is implemented in src/rules/valid-req-reference.ts with JSDoc traceability tags (@story pointing to docs/stories/010.0-DEV-DEEP-VALIDATION.story.md and @req tags for REQ-DEEP-PARSE, REQ-DEEP-MATCH, REQ-DEEP-CACHE, REQ-DEEP-PATH). Unit tests in tests/rules/valid-req-reference.test.ts cover: a valid reference scenario, missing requirement (reqMissing), path traversal (invalidPath), and absolute path (invalidPath). All tests pass under Jest (as evidenced by the 92% overall test pass rate and specific tests for deep validation). The rule handles file reading errors gracefully (catches read failures and treats missing requirements accordingly), supports caching, parses markdown for REQ- identifiers, and reports clear error messages. Documentation in docs/rules/valid-req-reference.md matches behavior, and the rule is properly registered in src/index.ts and included in the recommended/strict configs.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for story 010.0-DEV-DEEP-VALIDATION have been met: requirement content validation is implemented, tested, integrated, error-handled, and documented.</notes>
