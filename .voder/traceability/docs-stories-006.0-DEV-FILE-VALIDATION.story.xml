  <evidence>The `valid-story-reference` rule is implemented in src/rules/valid-story-reference.ts with all required checks (existence, extension, path traversal, absolute paths). Utility functions in src/utils/storyReferenceUtils.ts perform path resolution, existence checks with caching, and security validation. The rule is registered in src/index.ts and included in the recommended and strict configs. 

Tests in tests/rules/valid-story-reference.test.ts cover the core functionality: valid references, missing files (fileMissing), wrong extension (invalidExtension), path traversal, and absolute path errors (invalidPath). Schema validation tests in tests/config/eslint-config-validation.test.ts verify configurable options (storyDirectories, allowAbsolutePaths, requireStoryExtension). Documentation in docs/rules/valid-story-reference.md details behavior, options, examples, and references the story file. No tests failed when running the suite for this rule.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria are satisfied: core functionality, ESLint best practices, integration via plugin export and configs, clear error messages, handling of security edge cases, and documentation are present. The implementation includes caching for performance and boundary checks for project limits. Therefore, the story is fully implemented.</notes>
