  <evidence>- src/rules/valid-story-reference.ts implements the core functionality (@story annotation reference checks) with JSDoc tags pointing to docs/stories/006.0-DEV-FILE-VALIDATION.story.md and requirements REQ-FILE-EXISTENCE, REQ-PATH-RESOLUTION, REQ-SECURITY-VALIDATION, plus caching for REQ-PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION and support for configurable storyDirectories (REQ-CONFIGURABLE-PATHS).
- Tests in tests/rules/valid-story-reference.test.ts cover valid references, missing files (fileMissing), invalid extensions (invalidExtension), path traversal and absolute path cases (invalidPath).
- Documentation at docs/rules/valid-story-reference.md explains the rule, options, examples of valid/invalid references, and references the story file.
- DefaultStoryDirs and schema support configurable directories; clear error messages defined in rule.meta.messages.
- The rule uses fs.existsSync/statSync guarded by existsSync (graceful for permission issues) and path normalization for security, satisfying error handling and performance criteria.

  <notes>All acceptance criteria and requirements from 006.0-DEV-FILE-VALIDATION are implemented: core functionality, ESLint best practices, integration, clear error messaging, edge-case handling, and documentation. Tests pass, code implements caching, security checks, and configurable directories. </notes>
