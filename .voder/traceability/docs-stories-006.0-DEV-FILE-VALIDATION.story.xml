  <evidence>The `valid-story-reference` rule is implemented in `src/rules/valid-story-reference.ts` with JSDoc traceability annotations pointing to `docs/stories/006.0-DEV-FILE-VALIDATION.story.md`. It covers REQ-FILE-EXISTENCE, REQ-PATH-RESOLUTION, REQ-SECURITY-VALIDATION, REQ-PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION (caching), REQ-PROJECT-BOUNDARY, and REQ-CONFIGURABLE-PATHS via its schema and default options. 

Unit tests in `tests/rules/valid-story-reference.test.ts` exercise:
- Valid references (existing paths, correct extension, relative resolution)
- Invalid references (missing files, wrong extension, path traversal, absolute paths)

All 5 tests in that suite passed. The documentation in `docs/rules/valid-story-reference.md` and the example in `README.md` have been updated. The global test suite (97 tests across 18 suites) passes with zero failures (see `jest-report.json`).</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for core file-reference validation are met and backed by concrete test coverage. The rule is wired into the plugin, documented, and validated by ESLint tests.</notes>
