  <evidence>- src/rules/valid-story-reference.ts implements all core requirements (file existence, path resolution, security checks, extension check, configurable directories, caching).
- JSDoc annotations reference docs/stories/006.0-DEV-FILE-VALIDATION.story.md and REQ-FILE-EXISTENCE, REQ-PATH-RESOLUTION, REQ-SECURITY-VALIDATION.
- tests/rules/valid-story-reference.test.ts covers valid and invalid scenarios (missing file, wrong extension, path traversal, absolute path) and passes without errors.
- `npm test` reports 100% tests passing and coverage > 85% for this rule.</evidence>
  <notes>The implementation and tests fully satisfy the story’s acceptance criteria and technical requirements for validating @story annotations against existing .story.md files.</notes>
