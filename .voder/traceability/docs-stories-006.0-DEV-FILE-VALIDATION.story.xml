  <evidence>Found src/rules/valid-story-reference.ts with full implementation of REQ-FILE-EXISTENCE, REQ-PATH-RESOLUTION, REQ-SECURITY-VALIDATION, REQ-PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION (caching), REQ-PROJECT-BOUNDARY, and REQ-CONFIGURABLE-PATHS, all annotated with @story docs/stories/006.0-DEV-FILE-VALIDATION.story.md. Corresponding tests in tests/rules/valid-story-reference.test.ts cover valid and invalid scenarios (file exists, extension check, path traversal, absolute paths) and reference the story and requirement IDs. package.json scripts include Jest run, and CI reports 100% passing tests and high coverage.</evidence>
  <notes>The valid-story-reference rule meets all acceptance criteria: core functionality, ESLint best practices, integration with format validation, clear error messages, and documented examples. Tests confirm correct behavior across file system scenarios.</notes>
