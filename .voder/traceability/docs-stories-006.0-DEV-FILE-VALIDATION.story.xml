  <evidence>Rule implementation src/rules/valid-story-reference.ts includes all required logic for: REQ-FILE-EXISTENCE (existsAny), REQ-PATH-RESOLUTION (buildCandidates, ./ handling), REQ-SECURITY-VALIDATION (absolute‐path and .. checks), REQ-CONFIGURABLE-PATHS (options.storyDirectories), plus caching for performance. Tests in tests/rules/valid-story-reference.test.ts cover valid and invalid cases for file existence, extension, relative paths, path traversal, and absolute paths. The full test suite (19 suites, 106 tests) passes without failures.</evidence>
  <notes>All core acceptance criteria for 006.0-DEV-FILE-VALIDATION are satisfied: the rule validates that @story references point to existing .story.md files, emits clear error messages for missing or invalid paths, handles security edge cases, integrates as an ESLint rule, and follows best practices. Optional requirements (configurable dirs, caching) are implemented. Documentation exists in docs/stories/006.0-DEV-FILE-VALIDATION.story.md.</notes>
