  <evidence>1. src/index.ts exports configs.recommended and configs.strict as required by REQ-CONFIG-PRESETS (core functionality).
2. docs/config-presets.md and docs/eslint-9-setup-guide.md provide clear examples of flat-config usage and both recommended and strict presets (documentation).
3. eslint.config.js demonstrates ESLint v9 flat-config integration for JS and TS projects, with plugin loading and rule application (flat config best practices and project integration).
4. Rules’ meta.schema definitions support rule-specific options (REQ-RULE-OPTIONS), including storyDirectories customization in valid-story-reference (REQ-CUSTOMIZABLE-PATHS).
5. Existing Jest-based test suite passes with 100% success across unit, integration, and CLI tests; ESLint flat-config linting and type-checking pass with no errors.
6. No configuration conflicts or errors observed when running `npm run lint` and `npm test` locally as per cycle evidence.</evidence>
  <notes>The ESLint configuration story is fully implemented. The plugin exports both recommended and strict presets, follows ESLint v9 flat-config conventions, integrates smoothly with JS/TS projects, and is well documented and tested. All acceptance criteria and requirements are satisfied.</notes>
