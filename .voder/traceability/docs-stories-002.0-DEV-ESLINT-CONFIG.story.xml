  <evidence>- No dedicated troubleshooting guide found (no docs or user-docs file covering troubleshooting or common errors).
- While README and user-docs cover ESLint v9 setup and TypeScript integration, there is no documentation addressing mixed‐project setups or troubleshooting workflows as required.
- Although rule schemas enforce additionalProperties:false, there is limited end‐user guidance on handling invalid configuration options beyond schema errors.
</evidence>
  <notes>The core presets, flat‐config support, rule option schemas, and TypeScript/JavaScript integration are implemented and tested, satisfying much of the spec. However, the story’s acceptance criteria for “User Experience” (clear docs for common project types including mixed setups) and “Documentation” (comprehensive examples plus troubleshooting guide) are not fully met. A troubleshooting guide and expanded usage examples are missing, so the story is not fully implemented.</notes>
