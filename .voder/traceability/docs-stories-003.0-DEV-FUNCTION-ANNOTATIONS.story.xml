  <evidence>- The `require-req-annotation` rule only implements a listener for `FunctionDeclaration` nodes; it does not detect or enforce `@req` annotations on function expressions, arrow functions, or class methods as required by REQ-FUNCTION-DETECTION.
- No tests exist for `require-req-annotation` on arrow functions or function expressions; tests only cover `FunctionDeclaration`.
- The documentation for `require-story-annotation` (docs/rules/require-story-annotation.md) incorrectly states that the rule accepts no options (`schema: []`), while the implementation’s schema supports `scope` and `exportPriority` options.
- No tests verify TypeScript-specific syntax, decorators, or mixed JS/TS codebases, despite the acceptance criterion for TypeScript support.</evidence>
  <notes>While the plugin provides separate rules and tests for `@story` and `@req` annotations, it fails to fully implement REQ-FUNCTION-DETECTION for the `@req` rule (missing support for non-declaration functions) and has documentation mismatches. Therefore, not all acceptance criteria are met.</notes>
