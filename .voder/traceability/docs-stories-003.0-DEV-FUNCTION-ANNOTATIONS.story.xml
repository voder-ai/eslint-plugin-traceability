  <evidence>Inspection of src/rules/require-story-annotation.ts and src/rules/require-req-annotation.ts shows only FunctionDeclaration nodes are handled (no arrow functions, function expressions, or class methods), there is no support for TypeScript‐specific syntax or parser configuration in RuleTester (only default parser used), and neither rule exposes configuration to scope which functions are checked or to prioritize exported functions. Key requirements REQ-FUNCTION-DETECTION (expressions/arrow functions), REQ-CONFIGURABLE-SCOPE, REQ-EXPORT-PRIORITY, and REQ-TYPESCRIPT-SUPPORT are not implemented.</evidence>
  <notes>While basic function‐level detection and error reporting exist for missing @story and @req, the implementation does not satisfy the full breadth of acceptance criteria and technical requirements outlined in the story. Additional work is needed to support all function patterns, configurability, and TypeScript integration.</notes>
