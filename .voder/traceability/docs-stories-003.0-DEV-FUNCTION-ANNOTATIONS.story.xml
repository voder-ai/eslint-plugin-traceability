  <evidence>1) The `require-req-annotation` rule only checks FunctionDeclarations (no arrow functions, function expressions, or class methods), although the story’s REQ-FUNCTION-DETECTION mandates detection of all function forms.  
2) The published documentation in docs/rules/require-story-annotation.md still says “This rule does not accept any options” even though the code and tests support `scope` and `exportPriority` options.  
3) There are no tests or examples exercising TypeScript-specific syntax or decorators, nor malformed‐JSDoc edge cases mentioned in the acceptance criteria.</evidence>
  <notes>While the core ESLint rules and RuleTester suite for @story and @req annotations pass, the implementation does not fully satisfy the story’s requirements around universal function detection (REQ-FUNCTION-DETECTION), documentation of configuration options, TypeScript support, and error handling edge cases.</notes>
