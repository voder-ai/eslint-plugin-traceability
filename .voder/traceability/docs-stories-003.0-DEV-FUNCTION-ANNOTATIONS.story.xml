  <evidence>• Source files src/rules/require-req-annotation.ts and src/rules/require-story-annotation.ts both include @story references to docs/stories/003.0-DEV-FUNCTION-ANNOTATIONS.story.md and implement the required AST listeners (FunctionDeclaration, FunctionExpression, ArrowFunctionExpression, MethodDefinition, TSDeclareFunction, TSMethodSignature) with checks for @req and @story annotations.
• Comprehensive RuleTester suites in tests/rules/require-req-annotation.test.ts and tests/rules/require-story-annotation.test.ts reference the exact story file, cover valid and invalid cases for JavaScript and TypeScript functions, and all assertions pass.
• docs/rules/require-req-annotation.md and docs/rules/require-story-annotation.md provide documentation with examples linked to the story.
• Full test suite (19 suites, 106 tests) ran with `npm test -- --verbose` and all tests associated with Story 003.0 passed without failures (see jest-results.json).</evidence>
  <notes>The core functionality (detect missing @story and @req), TypeScript support, configurable scope and exportPriority for the @story rule, error location reporting, and documentation are all implemented and validated by passing tests. Therefore the story is fully satisfied.</notes>
