  <evidence>Inspection of src/rules/require-story-annotation.ts and src/rules/require-req-annotation.ts shows they only handle FunctionDeclaration nodes (no arrow functions, function expressions, class methods) and have no schema for configurability or scope control. The story’s requirements (REQ-CONFIGURABLE-SCOPE, REQ-EXPORT-PRIORITY, full REQ-FUNCTION-DETECTION across all function types, REQ-TYPESCRIPT-SUPPORT via AST utilities) are not implemented. While basic tests pass for simple cases, the rule does not satisfy all acceptance criteria of story 003.0-DEV-FUNCTION-ANNOTATIONS.</evidence>
  <notes>The implementation covers only basic FunctionDeclaration JSDoc checks for @story and @req but lacks support for arrow functions, expressions, config options, and prioritized/export-only checks. These gaps mean not all acceptance criteria are met.</notes>
