  <evidence>– Found rule implementation in src/rules/require-story-annotation.ts and src/rules/require-req-annotation.ts with @story refs to docs/stories/003.0-DEV-FUNCTION-ANNOTATIONS.story.md and correct schema/options.
– Tests for require-story-annotation (tests/rules/require-story-annotation.test.ts) cover missing/present @story on functions, arrow, class methods, TSDeclareFunction, TSMethodSignature, plus exportPriority and scope options.
– Tests for require-req-annotation (tests/rules/require-req-annotation.test.ts and utils) cover missing/present @req on functions including TypeScript syntax.
– Integration tests (tests/integration/cli-integration.test.ts) exercise CLI error reporting for both @story and @req annotations referencing this story.
– All 18 test suites (97 tests) passed (see jest-report.json), including deep validation of REQ-FUNCTION-DETECTION, REQ-ANNOTATION-REQUIRED, REQ-EXPORT-PRIORITY, REQ-CONFIGURABLE-SCOPE, REQ-TYPESCRIPT-SUPPORT.</evidence>
  <notes>The implementation fully satisfies the acceptance criteria and specific requirements of story 003.0-DEV-FUNCTION-ANNOTATIONS: core functionality, TypeScript/JavaScript support, configurable scope and export priority, clear error messages, and documentation examples are all present and validated by passing tests.</notes>
