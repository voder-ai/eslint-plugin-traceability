  <evidence>1) No rule or code changes targeting docs/stories/007.0-DEV-ERROR-REPORTING.story.md were found in src/rules.
2) Tests do not reference story 007.0 or verify enhanced error messages—no tests named or annotated for 007.0-DEV-ERROR-REPORTING.
3) Existing messages in src/rules/* use generic messageIds (e.g. "missingStory") and message text (e.g. "Missing @story annotation (REQ-ANNOTATION-REQUIRED)") without suggestions, context, or ESLint suggest API usage as required by REQ-ERROR-SUGGESTION, REQ-ERROR-CONTEXT, REQ-ERROR-SEVERITY.
4) No documentation of error‐message templates or formatting guidelines was added.</evidence>
  <notes>The 007.0-DEV-ERROR-REPORTING story defines acceptance criteria and requirements for improved, actionable error messages, but there is no implementation or test coverage for it. The existing plugin rules still emit basic/generic messages and lack suggested fixes, context, severity distinctions, or documentation. This story has not been implemented.</notes>
