  <evidence>1) No source files or tests reference docs/stories/007.0-DEV-ERROR-REPORTING.story.md.
2) The existing ESLint rules (003–006) define generic error messages (e.g. "Missing @story annotation") and do not implement the detailed, actionable messaging (REQ-ERROR-SPECIFIC, REQ-ERROR-LOCATION, REQ-ERROR-SUGGESTION, REQ-ERROR-CONTEXT, REQ-ERROR-CONSISTENCY, REQ-ERROR-SEVERITY) required by story 007.0.
3) No unit or integration tests verify the enhanced error‐message format or content for annotation violations.</evidence>
  <notes>The story for clear, actionable error reporting (007.0) has no implementation or tests. The current rules only provide basic, generic messages and do not satisfy any of the acceptance criteria for this story.</notes>
