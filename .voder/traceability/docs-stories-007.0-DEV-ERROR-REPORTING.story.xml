  <evidence>I searched the code and test suite for any references to `docs/stories/007.0-DEV-ERROR-REPORTING.story.md` or ‘007.0’ and found none. There is no dedicated rule or test coverage for error-message enhancements defined in this story. The existing ESLint rules define basic messageIds (e.g. “missingStory”, “missingReq”, “invalidPath”), but those messages do not include the required actionable suggestions (REQ-ERROR-SUGGESTION), contextual details about the expected format or available files (REQ-ERROR-CONTEXT), nor do any tests assert on the clarity, location details, or suggestion text. The CLI integration tests only verify exit codes, not message contents. No documentation or unit/integration tests cover REQ-ERROR-SPECIFIC, REQ-ERROR-LOCATION, REQ-ERROR-SUGGESTION, REQ-ERROR-CONTEXT and related acceptance criteria of story 007.</evidence>
  <notes>The specification 007.0-DEV-ERROR-REPORTING is present but not implemented. To satisfy it, the plugin must be enhanced so that all validation failures emit clear, contextualized error messages with actionable fix suggestions, and tests must be added to verify those messages and suggestions.</notes>
