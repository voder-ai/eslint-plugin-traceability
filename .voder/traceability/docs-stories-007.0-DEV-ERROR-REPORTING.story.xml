  <evidence>Found a dedicated Jest test for story 007 in tests/rules/error-reporting.test.ts, which references docs/stories/007.0-DEV-ERROR-REPORTING.story.md. The implementation in src/rules/require-story-annotation.ts defines a messageId “missingStory”, inserts a suggestion with the exact `desc` and `output` shape that the test expects, and uses the correct story path placeholder. All promise-style imports, meta.messages, and context.report(...) calls align with the test’s requirements.</evidence>
  <notes>The clear error-reporting enhancements for missing @story annotations required by story 007 are fully implemented: suggestions are present and correctly formatted, the rule integrates with ESLint’s reporting API, and a traceable, story-referencing test confirms the behavior. No acceptance criterion remains unverified.</notes>
