  <evidence>1) tests/rules/require-branch-annotation.test.ts references docs/stories/004.0-DEV-BRANCH-ANNOTATIONS.story.md and all valid/invalid RuleTester cases pass (npm test succeeds).  
2) src/rules/require-branch-annotation.ts implements an ESLint visitor for all specified branch node types and reports/fixes missing @story/@req.  
3) docs/rules/require-branch-annotation.md provides documentation with examples.  
4) src/index.ts exports the rule and it is included in configs.recommended/strict; plugin-default-export-and-configs.test.ts passes.  
5) Lint and build pipelines (npm run lint, npm run build) complete without errors.</evidence>
  <notes>All six acceptance‐criteria boxes in the story are satisfied: the core rule detects missing annotations, follows ESLint best practices, handles nested/blank‐line cases, emits clear messages, has documentation, and integrates into the plugin. Tests exercise both valid and invalid branch cases and all pass. Therefore the story implementation is complete.</notes>
