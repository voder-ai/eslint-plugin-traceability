  <evidence>In src/rules/require-branch-annotation.ts the rule.meta.schema is an empty array (schema: []), and the documentation (docs/rules/require-branch-annotation.md) explicitly states “This rule does not accept any options.” However, the story’s Requirements include REQ-CONFIGURABLE-SCOPE: “Allow configuration of which branch types require annotations.” There is no code to accept or handle any configuration options for branch scopes, nor any tests for that behavior.</evidence>
  <notes>While the core detection, parsing, and error reporting for branch annotations are implemented and well-tested, the required ability to configure which branch types are enforced is missing. The story is therefore not fully satisfied.</notes>
