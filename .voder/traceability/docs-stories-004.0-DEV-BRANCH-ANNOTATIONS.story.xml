  <evidence>The require-branch-annotation rule is implemented (`src/rules/require-branch-annotation.ts`) and fully tested (21 passing tests in `tests/rules/require-branch-annotation.test.ts`), with clear error messages and documentation in `docs/rules/require-branch-annotation.md`. However, the story’s requirement REQ-CONFIGURABLE-SCOPE (“Allow configuration of which branch types require annotations”) is not implemented: the rule’s meta.schema is `[]` (no options) and neither code nor docs expose any configuration for turning specific branch types on or off.</evidence>
  <notes>While core functionality, error reporting, nested handling, and documentation exist, the story explicitly calls for configurability of branch types. Since there is no schema or option support, one acceptance criterion remains unmet.</notes>
