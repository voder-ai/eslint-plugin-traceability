  <evidence>Previous assessment: PASSED
■ Rule implementation: src/rules/require-branch-annotation.ts contains the ESLint rule with @story docs/stories/004.0-DEV-BRANCH-ANNOTATIONS.story.md and @req REQ-BRANCH-DETECTION annotations.
■ Tests: tests/rules/require-branch-annotation.test.ts covers all major branch types (if, switch, loops, try/catch, fallback scanning), and the full test suite passes with 96.76% coverage (including 100% coverage for require-branch-annotation.ts).
■ Documentation: docs/rules/require-branch-annotation.md exists and references the story and requirement, and the rule is exported and enabled in src/index.ts and eslint.config.js.</evidence>
  <notes>Reset for re-assessment this cycle. Previous: All acceptance criteria for 004.0-DEV-BRANCH-ANNOTATIONS have been met: the rule detects missing @story/@req on significant branches, includes auto-fixes, clear messages, handles switch-case fallbacks, is integrated into configs, and is documented and tested.</notes>
