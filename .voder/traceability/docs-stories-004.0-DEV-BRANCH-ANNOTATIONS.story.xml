  <evidence>In src/rules/require-branch-annotation.ts, meta.schema is defined as an empty array (schema: []), and there is no handling of rule options or configuration for selecting which branch node types to validate. The story’s requirement REQ-CONFIGURABLE-SCOPE (‘Allow configuration of which branch types require annotations’) is not implemented. All other acceptance criteria appear satisfied (core functionality, tests, documentation), but configurability is missing.</evidence>
  <notes>The branch‐annotation rule correctly enforces annotations on all hard-coded branch types and is well-tested and documented. However, it does not expose any options to configure which branch types should be checked, in direct conflict with the story’s requirement for a configurable scope.</notes>
