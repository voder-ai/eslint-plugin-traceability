  <evidence>The `require-branch-annotation` ESLint rule is implemented in `src/rules/require-branch-annotation.ts`, its helpers in `src/utils/branch-annotation-helpers.ts`, and fully documented in `docs/rules/require-branch-annotation.md`. The unit tests in `tests/rules/require-branch-annotation.test.ts` cover all core AST node types (IfStatement, SwitchCase, Try/Catch, loops), missing‐annotation error messages, auto‐fix behavior, nested/default cases, configurable branchTypes, and invalid configuration. All 35 tests for this rule passed (see Jest summary: 0 failures).</evidence>
  <notes>The feature implements REQ-BRANCH-DETECTION, REQ-COMMENT-ASSOCIATION, REQ-ANNOTATION-PARSING, REQ-SIGNIFICANCE-CRITERIA, REQ-NESTED-HANDLING, REQ-CONFIGURABLE-SCOPE, and REQ-PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION. Documentation and examples exist, and the rule is wired into the plugin's index and config presets. Acceptance criteria for core functionality, configuration, user feedback, and documentation are satisfied.</notes>
