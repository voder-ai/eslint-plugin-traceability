  <evidence>The rule’s implementation in src/rules/require-branch-annotation.ts defines meta.schema = [] (no options) and the documentation (docs/rules/require-branch-annotation.md) explicitly states “This rule does not accept any options.” However, the story’s requirements include REQ-CONFIGURABLE-SCOPE (“Allow configuration of which branch types require annotations”), and there are no tests covering any configuration or option to limit branch types. The absence of a configurable schema and corresponding tests indicates that REQ-CONFIGURABLE-SCOPE has not been implemented.</evidence>
  <notes>All core detection and reporting functionality is implemented, tested, and documented, but the story’s requirement for a configurable scope of branch types is missing. To fully satisfy the story, the rule must accept and honor configuration options specifying which branch nodes to enforce.</notes>
