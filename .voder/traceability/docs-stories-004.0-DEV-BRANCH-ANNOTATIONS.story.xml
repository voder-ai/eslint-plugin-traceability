  <evidence>The `require-branch-annotation` rule’s implementation (src/rules/require-branch-annotation.ts) defines meta.schema as an empty array and hardcodes the set of branch node types (IfStatement, SwitchCase, TryStatement, etc.) with no provision for user configuration. The story’s Requirements include **REQ-CONFIGURABLE-SCOPE** (“Allow configuration of which branch types require annotations”), but there is no schema entry or code path to accept or honor configuration options. No tests exercise configuration of branch types.</evidence>
  <notes>Core detection is implemented and covered by tests, but the configurability requirement (REQ-CONFIGURABLE-SCOPE) is missing, so the story is not fully satisfied.</notes>
