  <evidence>- Rule implementation at src/rules/require-branch-annotation.ts includes @story/docs/stories/004.0-DEV-BRANCH-ANNOTATIONS.story.md and implements validateBranchTypes and reportMissingAnnotations per REQ-BRANCH-DETECTION, REQ-COMMENT-ASSOCIATION, REQ-ANNOTATION-PARSING, REQ-CONFIGURABLE-SCOPE
- Tests in tests/rules/require-branch-annotation.test.ts cover valid and invalid cases for all significant branch types (if, switch/case, loops, try/catch), configuration options, and schema errors, referencing the story file
- Documentation in docs/rules/require-branch-annotation.md provides rule details, examples, options, and references the story and requirements
- Plugin export in src/index.ts includes the rule in configs.recommended
- Invalid configuration behavior and autofix code paths are tested and passes lint+test suite</evidence>
  <notes>The branch-annotation rule exists, is traceably linked to the story, is included in the plugin, has comprehensive tests for core functionality, configuration, and documentation. All acceptance criteria and requirements for story 004.0 appear satisfied.</notes>
