## LATER

- [ ] Identify and complete the other remaining failing story from the functionality assessment once 003.0 is fully satisfied and validated.
- [ ] After 003.0 is stable, consider extracting shared helpers for configurable scope/exportPriority between @story and @req rules to reduce duplication, using a small, incremental refactor.
- [ ] Add any missing traceability annotations uncovered by the traceability report, especially around the new @req handling branches, and regenerate the traceability report.
