## NOW
Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file at the project root with contribution guidelines covering issue reporting, pull‐request process, commit‐message conventions, coding style, and instructions for running tests and quality checks.

## NEXT
- Update README.md to add a “Running Tests” section that shows how to execute `npm test`, view coverage reports, and enforce lint/format checks.  
- Add a “CLI Integration” section in README.md that explains how to use `cli-integration.js` (list available commands, flags, and example usage).  
- Create a new docs/cli‐integration.md with detailed documentation of the CLI integration script’s options, commands, and integration into developer workflows.

## LATER
- Document configuration presets by adding docs/config‐presets.md that explains the “recommended” and “strict” configs with usage examples.  
- Write an ADR in docs/decisions capturing the project’s documentation conventions and complexity standards.  
- Review docs/rules/ and insert placeholders or migration notes for stories 005–010 (annotation format, file validation, auto-fix, maintenance tools, deep validation).
