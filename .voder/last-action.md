**Response:**

```
I have successfully unified the CI/CD pipeline into a single `quality-and-deploy` job, removing redundant build and test steps across separate jobs. The updated workflow runs quality gates (build, type‐check, lint, duplication, tests, formatting, security audits) across Node.js 18.x and 20.x, and publishes via semantic-release on pushes (only for Node 20.x matrix) followed by a smoke test if a new release is published. 

All local quality checks passed, and I pushed the changes. The GitHub Actions workflow run succeeded. Next, we can document this decision with an ADR and consider further pipeline optimizations as planned. Let me know if you’d like me to proceed with ADR creation or any additional improvements.
